Rogue’s Gallery is a social media platform centered around user expression and collaborative storytelling which aims to facilitate these core values via usage of prompts. Periodically, users are provided a new prompt for a scenario or character they are encouraged to post from the perspective of.

These prompts could be anything from ‘Pirate Captain Desperately trying to impress his crew’ or ‘Door to door ice salesman in the Mojave Desert’. From here the users can post how they imagine they might in the prompted scenario and combine that with other users posts and characters.

In this, account and followers can almost take on the atmosphere of an improv group, building on each other's messages and prompts to create emergent narratives.

This concept is open to many different variations and expansions in scope. There could be days where everyone gets the same prompt and must work together, ‘Prompt Battles’ wherein half the user base gets one prompt and the other gets a different one, and specially themed days - there are many, many possibilities.

In all, Rogue’s Gallery aims to foster a positive and creative atmosphere via usage of prompting and encouragement of character work at large and between users.

Key frontend features include: account registration, login, posting, replies to posts, liokes, access to prompts and individualised accounts collating each user's posts.
