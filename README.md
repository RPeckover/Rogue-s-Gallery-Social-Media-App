Rogue’s Gallery is a social media platform centered around user expression and collaborative storytelling which aims to facilitate these core values via usage of prompts. Periodically, users are provided a new prompt for a scenario or character they are encouraged to post from the perspective of.

These prompts could be anything from ‘Pirate Captain desperately trying to impress their crew’ or ‘Door to door ice salesman in the Sahara Desert’. From here the users can post how they imagine they might in the prompted scenario and combine that with other users posts and characters.

In this, account and followers can almost take on the atmosphere of an improv group, building on each other's messages and prompts to create emergent narratives.

This concept is open to many different variations and expansions in scope. There could be days where everyone gets the same prompt and must work together, ‘Prompt Battles’ wherein half the user base gets one prompt and the other gets a different one, and specially themed days - there are many, many possibilities.

In all, Rogue’s Gallery aims to foster a positive and creative atmosphere via usage of prompting and encouragement of character work at large and between users.

Key frontend features include: account registration, login, posting, following other accounts, replies to posts, likes, access to prompts and an individualised page collating each user's posts.

The base version of this concept loads one prompt per user per day via a randomised function and that user's posts during this window are labelled with that prompt. After 24 hours, users wil be given a new prompt.

If a prompt already used is selected, it is placed in an array of used prompts.

Each users content is stored in an object and loaded onto their individual pages.

Posts can be replied to by users with different prompts to provide interesting interactions. These messages are displayed appended to the initial post but are stored seperatley with that user's object.

On the homepage users see posts from accounts they have liked/followed in the past and that have a lot of likes the latter of which is done via the post's object being checked for like count.
