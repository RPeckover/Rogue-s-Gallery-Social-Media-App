    <h2>The Rogue's Manifesto</h2>
    <p> 
        Rogue’s Gallery is a social media platform centered around comedic roleplay and 
        collaborative storytelling. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Periodically, you are provided a new prompt for a scenario or character and are encouraged 
        to post from the perspective of them.
        <br>
        <br>
        Your prompt could be anything from ‘Pirate Captain desperately trying to impress their crew’ 
        to ‘Door to door ice salesman in the Sahara Desert’. From here, all you have to do is post something
        how you imagine yur prompt might and can play off of other Rogues and their character prompts!
        <br>
        <br>
        Find other Rogues you enjoy posting with and forge your own impromptu Rogue's Gallery improv group, 
        building on each other's messages and characters to create emergent narratives.
        <br>
        <br> 
        The Possibilities are limitless.
        <br>
        <br>
        Whether you want and join and build positive and creative connections or just have fun with silly
        characters, you are welcome to the Rogue's Gallery.
